# Ventilation - A place to air out your grievances

The intent of this website is to be a social media page that allows users to post their grievances. From the Home page, you are able to look at all the posts users make, hide posts from your feed, and edit the username, title, or body of a post. The Life Advice page is where a user can vent anonymously without worry of ridicule. Other users can comment with advice on each post.

This repository houses the backend API for Ventilation. There are two models and two controllers, one each for the Home page and Life Advice page.

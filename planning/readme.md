# Ventilation - A place to air out your grievances
## Our Approach

Our team started off knowing we wanted to try a mix of pair programming and mob programming as a whole group, so we each chose the area we wanted to focus on: React or API. Once we had our pairs, we made a rough schedule which we were able to stick to. Anytime a pair was stuck on a bug, we all came back together to attempt to squash it. Our approach was a pretty even mix of small and large group work.

### User stories

Our users are people who just need to get things off their chest. Those who need to vent about their struggles in a space curated for just that reason. Our user could range from high schoolers complaining about doing chores to parents venting about the tantrum their toddler threw in the middle of a store.

### Descriptions of any unsolved problems or hurdles your team had to overcome.

Our unsolved problem is currently in our comment section of the Life Advice page. The comments are not able to properly post at this current stage.

Some major hurdles included working with two different fetch urls in the API and spending an entire day working on a post function in React only to have to redo all of it the next day.

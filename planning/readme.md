# Ventilation - A place to air out your grievances
## Our Approach

Our team started off knowing we wanted to try a mix of pair programming and mob programming as a whole group, so we each chose the area we wanted to focus on: React or API. Once we had our pairs, we made a rough schedule which we were able to stick to. Anytime a pair was stuck on a bug, we all came back together to attempt to squash it. Our approach was a pretty even mix of small and large group work.

### User stories

Our users are people who just need to get things off their chest. Those who need to vent about their struggles in a space curated for just that reason. Our user could range from high schoolers complaining about doing chores to parents venting about the tantrum their toddler threw in the middle of a store.
